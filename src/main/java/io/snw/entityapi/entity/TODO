Here's a small file which contains some stuff we may/could add

1) Custom pathfinders/navigation. So we can create players and make them wander randomly around.
2) Add different types of ControllableEntityBase's, suggestions: Fightable, Nameable, etc...
4) Add some easter eggs. We love easter eggs.

@DSH105, Nice work, but where do we set the spawn location? Maybe add it in the constructor.

---

1) Done ;D. Custom goals yet to be coded
2) Yup. Tick that off...
3) ;o
4) Location and rotation can be set in the spawn method (nms.Entity.setPositionRotation)
